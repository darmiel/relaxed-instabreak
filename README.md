This mod **adds a short cooldown after breaking a block while holding down the mouse button** (toggleable: while or while not sneaking).

It should be pretty similar to the creative mode experience -> blocks can be mined immediately, but it only breaks around 3 blocks per second, while holding down the mouse button.

ðŸ‘‰ **This mod works on servers**, but only needs to be installed on the client.

# Config
- `Reversed Behavior`: By default, Relaxed Instabreak is activated as soon as you sneak. If this option is enabled, Relaxed Instabreak will be disabled when sneaking.
- `Delay`: Cooldown after the removal of blocks in ticks. Default: 5 Ticks.

# Preview
Note: a Netherite Pickaxe with Efficiency V and Haste II was used in the demo.
